# TS-Forum
A forum website made with minimal dependencies (i hope), SvelteKit, TypeScript and lots of effort.
Name can change.

## Setup
TODO! Plans: admins should be able to just git clone this, add a database, build it, deploy it and then click a "Setup" button within the UI to add all the default ranks.

## Banning Users
To ban a user, you have to use a Rank that has no permissions and assign that to a user. If no "Banned" rank is defined, the "ban" option will not be available in the UI.
